/-! # VC Dimension for Concept Classes

This file defines *shattering* and the *Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension* for
concept classes modeled as `Set (Set α)`.  See also the `Finset`-based
definitions in `Mathlib.Combinatorics.SetFamily.Shatter`.

The VC dimension of a concept class `C` is the cardinality of the largest
finite set that `C` shatters: a set `W` is shattered by `C` if every
subset of `W` can be obtained as the intersection of `W` with some
concept in `C`.

## Main definitions

- `SetShatters C W`: the concept class `C` shatters the set `W`.
- `vcDim C`: the VC dimension of `C`, i.e., the supremum of the
  cardinalities of finite sets shattered by `C`.

## Main statements

- `SetShatters.subset`: shattering is anti-monotone in the shattered set.
- `SetShatters.superset`: shattering is monotone in the concept class.
- `Finset.Shatters.toSetShatters`: bridge from Mathlib's `Finset.Shatters`
  to `SetShatters`.

/-- The *Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension* of a concept class `C` is the
supremum of the cardinalities of finite sets shattered by `C`.
Returns `0` when no finite set is shattered (i.e., the defining set is empty).

**Caveat**: because `sSup` on `ℕ` returns `0` for unbounded sets, this definition
is only meaningful when the VC dimension is finite. -/
