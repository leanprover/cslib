/-! # Sample Complexity Lower Bound — Helper Lemmas

Generic reusable lemmas for product measures, sample functions, and
combinatorics used in the EHKV lower bound proof.

## Main definitions

- `seenElements W' xs`: the elements of a `Finset` that appear in a sample

## Main statements

- `one_sub_pow_le_mul`: Bernoulli's inequality `1 - (1-x)^n ≤ n·x`
- `sampleOf_eq_of_agree`: agreeing concepts yield the same labeled sample
- `hypothesisError_eq_of_inter_eq`: error invariance under same intersection
- `pi_measure_compl_zero`: product measure vanishes off `W^m`
- `nullMeasurableSet_pi_of_finite_support`: null-measurability from finite support
- `measurableSet_setOf_exists_pi_eq`: the set of samples containing a given point
  is measurable
- `measurable_seenElements_card`: `xs ↦ |seenElements W' xs|` is measurable
- `expected_seenElements_le`: Bernoulli integration bound on seen elements
