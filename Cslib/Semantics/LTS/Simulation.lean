/-! # Simulation and Similarity

A simulation is a binary relation on the states of an `LTS`: if two states `s1` and `s2` are related by a simulation, then
`s2` can mimic all transitions of `s1`. Furthermore, the derivatives reaches through
these transitions remain related by the simulation.

Similarity is the largest simulation: given an `LTS`, it relates any two states that are related
by a bisimulation for that LTS.

For an introduction to theory of simulation, we refer to [Sangiorgi2011].

## Main definitions

- `Simulation lts r`: the relation `r` on the states of the LTS `lts` is a simulation.
- `Similarity lts` is the binary relation on the states of `lts` that relates any two states
related by some simulation on `lts`.
- `SimulationEquiv lts` is the binary relation on the states of `lts` that relates any two states
similar to each other.

## Notations

- `s1 ≤[lts] s2`: the states `s1` and `s2` are similar in the LTS `lts`.
- `s1 ≤≥[lts] s2`: the states `s1` and `s2` are simulation equivalent in the LTS `lts`.

## Main statements

- `SimulationEquiv.eqv`: simulation equivalence is an equivalence relation.
