# Gale-Shapley 

In this directory, I have a Lean implementation of the Gale-Shapley algorithm. This implementation is being developed to rank candidates in a national exam for government job openings in Brazil, scheduled for October 2025.

In addition to the Lean code, I also tried to sketch a Boole version based on Dijkstraâ€™s example in the CSLib slides [4].

I didn't find any reference to Boole in the Strata repository [3]. What is the difference Boole and Boogie? For Boogie I found the following repo and tutorial.
  
- https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie?tab=readme-ov-file
- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/krml178.pdf
  
In one meeting, someone shared this link as a reference to what would be Boole. Is it right?
