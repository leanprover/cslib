/-! # Nondeterministic automata with ε-transitions. -/

/-- A nondeterministic finite automaton with ε-transitions (`εNFA`) is an `NA` with an `Option`
symbol type. The special symbol ε is represented by the `Option.none` case.

Internally, ε (`Option.none`) is treated as the `τ` label of the underlying transition system,
allowing for reusing the definitions and results on saturated transitions of `LTS` to deal with
ε-closure. -/
structure εNFA (State : Type _) (Symbol : Type _) extends NA State (Option Symbol) where
  /-- The automaton is finite-state. -/
  finite_state : Finite State
  /-- The type of symbols (also called 'alphabet') is finite. -/

/-- The `ε`-closure of a set of states `S` is the set of states reachable by any state in `S`
by performing only `ε`-transitions. We use `LTS.τClosure` since `ε` (`Option.none`) is an instance
of `HasTau.τ`. -/
