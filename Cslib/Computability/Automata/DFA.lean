A Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) is a finite-state machine that accepts or rejects
a finite string.

/-- A Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) consists of a labelled transition function
`tr` over finite sets of states and labels (called symbols), a starting state `start` and a finite
set of accepting states `accept`. -/
structure DFA (State : Type _) (Symbol : Type _) extends DA State Symbol where
  /-- The automaton is finite-state. -/
  finite_state : Finite State
  /-- The type of symbols (also called 'alphabet') is finite. -/
  finite_symbol : Finite Symbol


namespace DFA

/-- Extended transition function.

Implementation note: compared to [Hopcroft2006], the definition consumes the input list of symbols
from the left (instead of the right), in order to match the way lists are constructed.
