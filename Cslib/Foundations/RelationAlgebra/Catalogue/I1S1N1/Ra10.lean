# Catalogue algebra ⟨1, 1, 1⟩, number 10

Entry 10 in the ⟨1, 1, 1⟩ row of
[Jipsen’s catalogue](https://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/gap/ramaddux.html).
The source lists cycles `abb~ bbb~ bbb`.
Identity cycles are supplied by `cycleClosure`; only diversity cycles are stored below.
The algebraic and classification results are stated with proofs deferred.
