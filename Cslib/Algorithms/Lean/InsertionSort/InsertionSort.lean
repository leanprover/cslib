# InsertionSort on a list

In this file we introduce `insert` and `insertionSort` algorithms that return a time monad
over the list `TimeM ℕ (List α)`. The time complexity of `insertionSort` is the number of
comparisons.

--
## Main results

- `insertionSort_correct`: `insertionSort` permutes the list into a sorted one.
- `insertionSort_time`: The number of comparisons of `insertionSort` is at most `(n * (n - 1)) / 2`.
