# Code organisation

This document gives an overview of how the codebase is structured, in terms of directories.

**Note** that this organisation is still under active discussion and is subject to change.

# Codebase organisation

  - Foundations. General-purpose definitions and results (complexity theory, semantics, etc.).
    - Data. General-purpose structures and types.
      - HasFresh. Types equipped with a `fresh` generator (given a finite set, it generates an element not in that set).
      - …
