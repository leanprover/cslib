# Governance model for cslib

Cslib is governed by two main bodies:
- A [steering committee](#steering-committee), responsible for securing financial support and guiding the overall vision of the project.
- A [maintainer team](#maintainers), responsible for curating, expanding, and maintaining the code repository and its technical direction.

These groups work together to define the project's roadmap and foster a welcoming and productive environment.
New members may be invited based on project needs and individual merit (e.g., contributions, review activity).


## Steering committee

- Clark Barrett (@barrettcw), Stanford University and Amazon.
- Swarat Chaudhuri (@swaratchaudhuri), Google DeepMind and UT Austin.

- Fabrizio Montesi (@fmontesi), University of Southern Denmark and Danish Institute for Advanced Study.
- Leonardo de Moura (@leodemoura), Lean FRO and Amazon.

## Maintainers

The maintainer team is responsible for the quality of the codebase, establishing technical standards and ensuring coherence across contributions.

### Lead maintainer

The lead maintainer coordinates the overall work of the maintainer team and oversees the project's repositories.

- Fabrizio Montesi (@fmontesi), University of Southern Denmark and Danish Institute for Advanced Study.

### Technical leads

Technical leads guide long-term developments that may span multiple areas of the codebase, offering specialised expertise.

- Alexandre Rademaker (@arademaker), Atlas Computing and Getulio Vargas Foundation.
- Sorrachai Yingchareonthawornchai (@sorrachai), ETH Zurich.

### Area maintainers

Area maintainers are trusted contributors who take ownership of specific areas of the codebase, supporting their growth both as subject-matter experts and reviewers.

- Chris Henson (@chenson2018), Drexel University. Areas: Lambda calculus, metaprogramming.
- Kim Morrison (@kim-em), Lean FRO. Areas: Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) with upstream (Lean, mathlib).
